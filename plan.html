<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Ramesh Durai<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc310886</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>- Broadcast the existence of the company.<br>
  - Promotion of provided services, costumes, and parties.<br>
  - Promotion of the company and services toward youth in the area.<br>
  - Provide information on cosplay to anyone who may be curious.
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Advertising on the site will be consistent, and the only major change to the company's daily runnings. As such, any changes to the sales of the business can logically be attributed to the website. <br>
The performance of the site will be measured over a 3 month period.<br>
Both the age group of the clients, as well as the quantity will be taken into consideration.
</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The current clientele of CossiePlay are adults around 35 – 50. </p>
<p>The point of the website project is to appeal to a younger audience, with a focus on getting high school kids and young adults cosplaying.</p>
<p>As such, while the site should appeal to a younger clientele, the site should also be accessible to our original clients.</p>
